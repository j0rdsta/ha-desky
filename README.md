## Troubleshooting

### Desk Not Found
- Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your Home Assistant host
- Check that the desk is powered on
- Try moving closer to the desk during setup
- Verify the desk name starts with "Desky"

### Connection Issues
- The integration automatically reconnects if connection is lost
- Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure no other device is connected to the desk
- Try restarting the desk by unplugging it for 10 seconds

### ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy
This integration fully supports ESPHome Bluetooth proxies. To use:
1. Set up an ESPHome device with `esp32_ble_tracker` and `bluetooth_proxy`
2. The desk will be discovered through the proxy automatically

## Technical Details

### BLE Protocol
The integration uses the following BLE commands:
- Move Up: `0xF1 0xF1 0x01 0x00 0x01 0x7E`
- Move Down: `0xF1 0xF1 0x02 0x00 0x02 0x7E`
- Stop: `0xF1 0xF1 0x2B 0x00 0x2B 0x7E`
- Preset 1-4: Various command codes

Height notifications use header `0x98 0x98` with height data at bytes 4-5.
